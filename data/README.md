# Data

This data folder contains three files. Advertising.csv is our original data set on which the linear model is applied. The data file can be downloaded at http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Advertising.csv, credited to Gareth James, Deniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani.

Eda-output is the file that contains all the summary statistics of TV and sales. It is saved via sink() by running the eda-script.R file. 

regression.RData includes the regression objects we obtained by running the linear regression model in binary format. This file is produced via save() from the regression-script.R file.
